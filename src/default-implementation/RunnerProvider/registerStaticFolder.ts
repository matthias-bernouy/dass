/**
 * Recursively registers every file under `folderEntry` as a GET route on
 * `runner`, using the path relative to the folder as the URL. Runs
 * synchronously so callers (typically `register…Endpoints` helpers invoked
 * from a class constructor) don't have to race `runner.start()`.
 *
 * Example: `registerStaticFolder("./static", runner)` with
 *   static/admin/dashboard.html → GET /admin/dashboard.html
 *   static/forbidden.html       → GET /forbidden.html
 *
 * Files are read from disk lazily at each request via `Bun.file`, so memory
 * use stays flat even on large trees.
